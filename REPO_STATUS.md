- No testing framework or tests implemented

## Next Steps

1. Implement a testing framework and add unit and integration tests
2. Complete the documentation, especially the database schema and API integration details
3. Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
4. Convert static data to dynamic API calls as outlined in the integration plan
5. Add or improve test coverage
